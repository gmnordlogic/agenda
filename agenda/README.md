#AngularJS Agenda
Demonstrates Angular modularity, testing, Gulp task automation, and more.

## Structure
	/build 	(created on the fly)
	/gulp	
	/src
		/client
			/app
			/content
			/test
		/server
			/data
			/routes
	
## Requirements

- Install Node
- Type `npm install -g node-inspector bower gulp`
- Type `bower install`

## Running
Runs locally, no database required.

### Dev Builds
The dev build does not optimize the deployed code. It simply runs it in place. You can run a dev build in multiple ways.

####Option 1 - Serve
Type `gulp serve-dev` and browse to `http://localhost:7200`

####Option 2 - Serve and Debug Node
Type `gulp serve-dev-debug` and browse to `http://localhost:7200` for the client and `http://localhost:8080/debug?port-5858` to debug the server.

####Option 3 - Serve and Debug Node Breaking on 1st Line
Type `gulp serve-dev-debug-brk` and browse to `http://localhost:7200` for the client and `http://localhost:8080/debug?port-5858` to debug the server.

### Staging Build
The staging build is an optimized build. Type `gulp serve-stage` and browse to `http://localhost:7200`

The optimizations are performed by the gulp tasks and include the following list. See the `gulpfile.js` for details

- jshint
- preparing Angular's templatecache for html templates
- concat task to bundle css and js, separately
- Angular dependency injection annotations using ngAnnotate
- uglify to minify and mangle javascript
- source maps
- css autoprefixer for vendor prefixes
- minify css
- optimize images
- index.html injection for scripts and links
- deploying all js, css, images, fonts, and index.html

## Testing
Type `gulp test` to run the tests including both unit and midway tests (spins up a server). This will create a watch on the files, with a 5 second delay, to run the tests.

Testing uses karma, mocha, chai, sinon, ngMidwayTester libraries.
